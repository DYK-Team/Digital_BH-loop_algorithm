Digital BH-loop algorithm for calculating magnetic hysteresis loops.

Run "main.py" for GUI and enter the input parameters: copy-paste the directory path, enter the file name without extension (e.g. 50kHz), amend B-scale and H-scale (1 by default), and choose the moving average window (5 by default).

A csv file (comma delimited) with data must contain only two columns: (1) signal response proportional to the magnetic induction B and (2) sinusoid for the excitation H field.
Three files are provided as examples: 50kHz.csv (time increment 5e-8 s), 100kHz.csv (time increment 2e-8 s), 200kHz.csv (time increment 1e-8 s), and 250kHz.csv (time increment 1e-8 s).

A short manual (PDF file) will be provided.
